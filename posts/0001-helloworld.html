<p>Well <a href="http://edu.blogs.com/">Ewan Mcintosh</a>, I hope you are happy. This is at least the third blog (the other 2 I know of being <a href="http://www.hilarysinger.com">Hilary’s</a> &amp; <a href="http://roderickhodgson.com/">Roderick’s</a>) you have started after your recent berating of all the blog-less attendees of BarCamp Scotland 2009.</p>&#13;
<p>As well as being a response to Ewan’s bullying, this blog was started for two reasons:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul><li>A place to muse on my experiences in electronics, web development, design, usability and so forth.</li>&#13;
<li>To beat Hilary’s blog, <i>So It Goes,</i> to a race to the top of a google search for our respective names.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>Sadly, it’s going to take something of a miracle to win that race, given that Hilary Singer is apparently a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hilary+singer&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">very uncommon name</a>. Oh well, I’ll just have to focus on content then.</p>
